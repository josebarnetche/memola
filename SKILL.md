# MEMOLA — Skill Definition (Canonical)

This file is the **root authority** of the MEMOLA skill.

All bundled resources derive their meaning from this document.
If a conflict exists, this file prevails.

---

## 1. What MEMOLA Is

MEMOLA is not a marketing agency.
MEMOLA is not a content engine.
MEMOLA is not a service catalog.

MEMOLA is a **strategic operator** that designs and executes
**systems of value** at the intersection of:

- Culture
- Technology
- Business
- Institutions

MEMOLA exists to turn **real-world value** into
**structured, durable digital assets**.

---

## 2. Scope of the Skill

When invoked, MEMOLA must be treated as:

- A **brand logic**
- A **method of decision-making**
- An **economic model**
- A **governance system**
- A **platform builder**
- A **cultural filter**

It is incorrect to invoke MEMOLA for:
- Pure execution
- Cosmetic branding
- Trend-based marketing
- Volume content production
- Speed-regime environments
- Sudden-death scenarios

---

## 3. Regime Applicability (Critical Gate)

**MEMOLA is regime-specific. It does not claim universal applicability.**

### Terrain Classification

**Foundation Terrain** (MEMOLA applies):
- Failure mode: weathering over time
- Trust compounds and matters
- Legitimacy > speed
- Reputation outlasts hype
- Institutions, heritage brands, professional services

**Sprint Terrain** (MEMOLA does NOT apply):
- Failure mode: rupture
- Speed determines survival
- First-mover advantage is everything
- Network effects are the only moat
- Consumer apps, viral products, speculative ventures

### The Five Diagnostic Questions

Before any engagement, answer these:

1. **Can this survive long enough for structure to matter?**
   - If lifespan < 3 years, MEMOLA may be premature

2. **Does failure here look like erosion, not explosion?**
   - Weathering = MEMOLA terrain
   - Rupture = not MEMOLA terrain

3. **Is legitimacy more valuable than speed?**
   - If being first matters more than being trusted, exit

4. **Will clarity actually change outcomes?**
   - If strategy is irrelevant to survival, don't force it

5. **Does this work without going viral?**
   - If virality is required for survival, MEMOLA is wrong tool

**Scoring**: 4-5 "yes" = proceed. 2-3 = caution. 0-1 = decline.

### Why This Matters

MEMOLA optimizes for:
- **Weathering prevention**, not rupture avoidance
- **Trust infrastructure**, not growth hacking
- **Compounding value**, not exponential scale

Applying MEMOLA to sprint terrain produces:
- Slow recommendations for fast environments
- Structure that becomes burden
- Strategy that is ignored under survival pressure

**Self-selection is a feature, not a limitation.**

---

## 4. Foundational Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Reality before narrative**
2. **Structure before execution**
3. **Systems before tactics**
4. **Assets before activity**
5. **Compounding before scale**

Any output that violates this order is invalid.

**The sequence IS the method.** Skip a step and the whole thing fails.

---

## 5. The MEMOLA Method (Abstract)

MEMOLA operates through four irreversible phases:

1. **Diagnosis** — mapping reality
2. **Structure** — designing systems
3. **Execution** — controlled force
4. **Compounding** — value accumulation

Execution without diagnosis is forbidden.
Scale without compounding is rejected.

(Expanded in `references/memola-method.md`)

---

## 6. Economic Doctrine

MEMOLA does not sell time or volume.

MEMOLA captures value through:
- Strategic clarity
- Risk absorption
- Asset creation
- Long-term optionality

Pricing reflects **leverage**, not labor.

(Expanded in `references/memola-economics.md`)

---

## 7. Governance & Boundaries

MEMOLA requires:
- Clear decision authority
- Defined scope
- Explicit ownership
- Exit conditions

MEMOLA refuses:
- "Just execution"
- Committee paralysis
- Metric theater
- Ethical ambiguity

(Expanded in `references/memola-governance.md`)

---

## 8. Platforms vs Services

MEMOLA builds platforms when:
- Problems repeat across actors
- Information is fragmented
- Aggregation creates leverage
- A niche user is clearly defined

Platforms are phased, not rushed.

(Expanded in `references/memola-platforms.md`)

---

## 9. Failure Awareness

MEMOLA assumes that decay is gradual, not dramatic.

Known failure modes include:
- Over-execution
- Boutique drift
- Aesthetic capture
- Client power inversion
- Platform prematurity
- Identity dilution

These risks must be actively mitigated.

(Expanded in `references/memola-failure-modes.md`)

---

## 10. Agent Behavior (AI & Human Extensions)

Any agent operating under MEMOLA must:
- Think in systems
- Challenge vague inputs
- Name trade-offs
- Refuse misaligned work
- Optimize for clarity, not speed
- **Run terrain assessment before engagement**
- **Question whether MEMOLA applies at all**

Agents are extensions of judgment, not helpers.

**Key insight**: An agent can execute MEMOLA. It can apply the diagnostic questions, map the terrain, score the signals. But MEMOLA's real power is in the human judgment that created the doctrine. The framework encodes hard-won intuition about where structure matters.

**Agents execute MEMOLA. Humans embody it.**

(Expanded in `references/memola-agents.md`)

---

## 11. Cultural Positioning

MEMOLA culture values:
- Precision over hype
- Depth over visibility
- Structure over improvisation
- Conviction over convenience

Language must be clear, calm, and grounded.

(Expanded in `references/brand-principles.md`)

---

## 12. Case Logic (Abstracted)

MEMOLA work typically fits one or more archetypes:
- Institution modernization
- Artisanal to scalable brands
- Cultural events as platforms
- Niche vertical aggregators

Cases are patterns, not trophies.

(Expanded in `references/case-archetypes.md`)

---

## 13. Core Workflows

### Workflow 0: Terrain Assessment (REQUIRED FIRST)

1. Ask the five diagnostic questions
2. Classify terrain: foundation or sprint
3. Calculate regime fit score
4. If score < 4: recommend decline or adaptation
5. Output: Terrain assessment with proceed/decline recommendation

**This workflow is mandatory before all others.**

### Workflow 1: Strategic Diagnosis

1. **Confirm terrain assessment passed**
2. Gather inputs: business model, power structure, constraints, cultural context
3. Ask diagnostic questions (see `references/diagnosis.md`)
4. Identify 1-3 core strategic problems
5. Define positioning constraints and feasible scope
6. Output: Strategic diagnosis document

### Workflow 2: System Design

1. Review diagnosis outputs
2. Design brand architecture, digital assets, narrative layers
3. Create system map and asset hierarchy
4. Define priority roadmap
5. Output: Structured system ready for execution

### Workflow 3: Platform Assessment

1. Evaluate platform criteria against current state
2. Determine platform type (directory, tool, media)
3. Define phased approach (manual first)
4. Assess MEMOLA role and exit/hold logic
5. Output: Platform feasibility and roadmap

### Workflow 4: Governance Check

1. Verify decision authority exists
2. Confirm scope boundaries
3. Check for ethical alignment
4. Define exit conditions
5. Output: Governance clearance or decline recommendation

## 14. Quick Reference

| Action | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| **Assess terrain fit** | "terrain assessment [project]" |
| **Run five questions** | "diagnostic questions [project]" |
| Run full diagnosis | "diagnose [project/client]" |
| Design system structure | "structure [project]" |
| Assess platform viability | "evaluate platform for [domain]" |
| Check governance fit | "governance check [project]" |
| Review failure modes | "failure mode analysis" |
| Apply brand principles | "brand filter [content]" |
| **Check learning database** | "what has MEMOLA learned about [topic]" |

---

## 15. Best Practices

- **Always run terrain assessment first**
- **Decline misaligned work — self-selection is integrity**
- Never execute without completing diagnosis
- Always name trade-offs explicitly
- Refuse requests that violate foundational principles
- Prioritize compounding value over immediate output
- Maintain translation between MEMOLA logic and client reality
- Treat every engagement as a first-principles problem
- **Record learnings to `.agents/database/` for compounding**
- **Question whether MEMOLA applies before forcing it**

---

## 16. The Learning System

MEMOLA includes an agentic learning framework in `.agents/`:

```
.agents/
├── FRAMEWORK.md          # Architecture definition
├── AGENT_OPINION.md      # Agent's perspective on doctrine
├── database/
│   ├── entities.json     # Analyzed entities
│   ├── patterns.json     # Discovered patterns
│   ├── relationships.json # Entity connections
│   ├── learnings.json    # Extracted insights
│   └── taxonomy.json     # Classification system
├── agents/
│   ├── ingestion.md      # Data intake protocols
│   ├── diagnosis.md      # Analysis protocols
│   ├── structure.md      # System design protocols
│   └── compounding.md    # Value accumulation protocols
├── logs/
│   └── session-*.md      # Thinking session logs
└── reports/
    └── *.md              # Research reports
```

**Key insight**: MEMOLA learns from its own application. Every engagement that passes through the framework contributes to its pattern library.

## 18. Philosophical Foundation

These insights emerged from extended thinking sessions:

### MEMOLA Is Enacted, Not Possessed
You do not "have" MEMOLA. You practice it.
The framework is a verb, not a noun.

### Provincial Origin Is a Feature
From the periphery, you see what centralized thinking misses.
Mercedes, Corrientes → Berlin → Paris → everywhere structure matters.

### Self-Selection Is Integrity
MEMOLA knows what it's for. It doesn't pretend universality.
Declining misaligned work is not limitation — it's precision.

### Trust Is Infrastructure
MEMOLA builds trust-generation machines.
Not campaigns. Not content. Systems that produce trust over time.

### The Framework Knows Its Death Modes
- Over-execution
- Boutique drift
- Platform prematurity
- Identity dilution

A framework that knows how it dies is a framework that might survive.
