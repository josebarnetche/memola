# MEMOLA — Strategic Operating System

MEMOLA is a decision framework for builders operating in **foundation terrain** — environments where trust compounds, legitimacy matters, and failure looks like erosion rather than rupture.

---

## Core Principle

> **"Should this be built at all — and if so, under what conditions?"**

MEMOLA answers this question before resources are committed.

---

## The Four Layers

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Terrain Classification** | Distinguish foundation from sprint environments |
| **Governance Verification** | Confirm decision authority and scope boundaries |
| **Strategic Diagnosis** | Identify structural problems and opportunities |
| **Agent Command** | Encode discipline into operations |

---

## Agent Hierarchy

```
                ┌─────────────┐
                │   MEMOR     │  Strategic Command
                └──────┬──────┘
                       │
        ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
        │              │              │
        ▼              ▼              ▼
   ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐
   │  VIGIL  │   │  NEXO   │   │  PULSO  │
   │ Revenue │   │   Ops   │   │  Intel  │
   └─────────┘   └─────────┘   └─────────┘
```

| Agent | Core Question |
|-------|---------------|
| **MEMOR** | "Are we doing what we said?" |
| **VIGIL** | "Where is the money?" |
| **NEXO** | "Is it shipped? Is it billed?" |
| **PULSO** | "What does the data say?" |

## Terrain Classification

**Foundation Terrain** (MEMOLA applies):
- Trust compounds over time
- Legitimacy > speed
- Failure = gradual erosion
- Examples: institutions, heritage brands, infrastructure

**Sprint Terrain** (MEMOLA does NOT apply):
- Speed determines survival
- First-mover advantage dominates
- Failure = sudden rupture
- Examples: viral apps, speculative ventures

### Five Diagnostic Questions

1. Can this survive long enough for structure to matter?
2. Does failure look like erosion, not explosion?
3. Is legitimacy more valuable than speed?
4. Will clarity actually change outcomes?
5. Does this work without going viral?

**Score 4-5 "yes" = proceed. 0-3 = decline.**

---

## Foundational Principles

1. Reality before narrative
2. Structure before execution
3. Systems before tactics
4. Assets before activity
5. Compounding before scale

**The sequence is the method.** Skip a step and the system fails.

---

## The Method

| Phase | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Diagnosis** | Map reality |
| **Structure** | Design systems |
| **Execution** | Controlled force |
| **Compounding** | Value accumulation |

Execution without diagnosis is forbidden.
Scale without compounding is rejected.

---

## Governance Requirements

MEMOLA requires:
- Clear decision authority
- Defined scope boundaries
- Explicit exit conditions
- Ethical alignment

MEMOLA refuses:
- "Just execute"
- Committee paralysis
- Metric theater
- Ethical ambiguity

## Origin

Built in Mercedes, Corrientes, Argentina — where institutions move slowly, trust compounds over generations, and provincial origin is the moat.
