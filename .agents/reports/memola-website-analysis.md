## 10. Conclusions

### The Real MEMOLA Is...
1. **A working agency** with documented client results
2. **A methodology in practice** that predates its codification as a skill
3. **A cultural positioning** rooted in Argentine provincial identity
4. **An expanding operation** moving from NEA to national to international
5. **A belief system** about value creation that rejects "metric theater"

### The MEMOLA Skill Is...
1. **An abstraction** of the agency's operational principles
2. **A decision-making framework** derived from real engagements
3. **A quality control mechanism** to filter aligned vs misaligned work
4. **A teaching tool** to extend MEMOLA judgment to agents and collaborators

### Key Insight
The skill and the agency are **mutually reinforcing**. The skill codifies what the agency practices; the agency tests and validates what the skill prescribes. This is not theory—it is **documented operational doctrine** backed by measurable case outcomes.
