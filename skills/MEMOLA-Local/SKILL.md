## 3. Why NEA Is Foundation Terrain

NEA is archetypal foundation terrain:

| MEMOLA Criterion | NEA Reality |
|------------------|-------------|
| Weathering failure | Businesses decline over generations, not quarters |
| Trust compounds | Third-generation relationships matter |
| Legitimacy > speed | Being known > being first |
| Reputation outlasts | Family names carry weight for decades |
| History creates advantage | Established players have deep roots |

**This is MEMOLA's home terrain.**

## 5. Regional Diagnostic Additions

### Standard Five Questions + Regional Modifiers

**Question 1 (Survival) — Regional modifier**:
- Family businesses score +0.5 if multi-generational
- Cooperatives score +0.5 if membership stable

**Question 2 (Failure mode) — Regional modifier**:
- Agricultural entities: check commodity price exposure
- Tourism entities: check seasonality vulnerability

**Question 3 (Legitimacy) — Regional modifier**:
- Score +0.5 if entity has 20+ year local presence
- Score -0.5 if entity is Buenos Aires transplant

**Question 4 (Clarity) — Regional modifier**:
- Score -0.5 if decision-maker is absent (estancia owner in BA)
- Score +0.5 if owner is operationally present

**Question 5 (Virality) — Regional modifier**:
- Most NEA entities automatically score YES
- Exception: tourism ventures seeking international viral reach

## 6. Regional Engagement Principles

### Principle 1: Presence Matters

NEA business is done in person. Digital supports but doesn't replace.

Applications:
- Visit before proposing
- Attend regional events
- Maintain physical presence schedule
- Video calls acceptable but not primary

### Principle 2: Calendar Awareness

Regional business follows agricultural and institutional calendars.

Key periods:
- **Exposiciones**: April-October (peak institutional activity)
- **Harvest seasons**: Varies by crop (cash flow availability)
- **Summer**: December-February (reduced activity)
- **Fiestas**: Regional celebrations affect scheduling

Plan engagements around these rhythms.

### Principle 3: Relationship Before Transaction

Don't pitch before you're known.

Approach:
- Introduction through existing relationship
- Informal meeting before formal proposal
- Multiple touchpoints before engagement
- Long courtship, long relationship

### Principle 4: Modest Technology

Don't over-engineer for the regional context.

Right-sized solutions:
- WhatsApp > custom apps
- Simple websites > complex platforms
- Social presence > omnichannel
- Working solutions > impressive solutions

### Principle 5: Local Partners

Build regional delivery capacity.

Partner types:
- Local photographers/videographers
- Regional media contacts
- Agricultural sector specialists
- Institutional relationship holders

## 8. Regional Pricing Considerations

### Reality Check

NEA pricing cannot match Buenos Aires rates:
- Lower cost of living
- Smaller budgets
- Longer payment cycles
- Relationship-based negotiation

### Pricing Approaches

**Value-based (preferred)**:
- Price on outcome, not hours
- Tie to measurable business impact
- Allows premium for genuine value

**Retainer (for ongoing)**:
- Lower monthly base
- Longer commitment terms
- Seasonal flexibility built in

**Hybrid**:
- Project fee for defined deliverables
- Maintenance retainer for ongoing support

### Payment Realities

- Cash flow follows harvest
- Budget available post-exposition/post-season
- Payment cycles longer (45-90 days)
- Relationship trust enables flexibility

---

## 9. Regional Competitive Landscape

### Competitors

**Buenos Aires agencies**:
- Higher prices
- Less regional understanding
- Remote delivery limitations
- Cultural mismatch

**Local operators**:
- Price competitive
- Limited strategic sophistication
- Execution-focused
- Relationship advantage

**MEMOLA positioning**:
- Regional presence + strategic sophistication
- Foundation methodology for foundation terrain
- Long-term partnership orientation
- Fair regional pricing

### Differentiation

MEMOLA wins in NEA by being:
1. **Present** (not remote)
2. **Patient** (not transactional)
3. **Strategic** (not just execution)
4. **Regional** (not Buenos Aires transplant)
5. **Sophisticated** (not limited to basics)

- What Buenos Aires agencies miss

This isn't limitation. This is competitive advantage in the right terrain.
