## What is MEMOLA?

MEMOLA is a strategic methodology for designing and executing **systems of value** at the intersection of culture, technology, business, and institutions.

But more importantly: MEMOLA is a **terrain detector**. Before applying any strategy, it asks:

> "Is this the kind of place where our tools work?"

MEMOLA is not universal. It is **regime-specific**. It works in environments where:
- Trust compounds over time
- Legitimacy matters more than speed
- Failure looks like weathering, not sudden explosion
- Long-term value creation is possible

If you're building a foundation, MEMOLA can help. If you're racing to set up sprint before competitors, MEMOLA is the wrong tool.

---

## Origin

MEMOLA was born in **Mercedes, Corrientes, Argentina** — a small city in the NEA (Northeast Argentina) region. It was developed by [MEMOLA Medios S.A.S.](https://memola.com.ar), a digital strategy agency founded by Jose Barnetche.

The methodology emerged from real client work: rural institutions with 100+ year histories, artisanal producers going digital, cultural events becoming platforms. These weren't Silicon Valley startups. They were foundations — entities where patience, structure, and trust actually matter.

Provincial origin is a feature, not a limitation. From the periphery, you see what centralized thinking misses.

---

## The Five Principles

MEMOLA operates on five foundational principles, in strict sequence:

1. **Reality before narrative** — Understand before you position
2. **Structure before execution** — Design before you build
3. **Systems before tactics** — Architecture before sprintaigns
4. **Assets before activity** — Create value containers before filling them
5. **Compounding before scale** — Depth before breadth

**The sequence is the method.** Skip a step and the whole thing fails.

## The Five Diagnostic Questions

Before any engagement, MEMOLA asks:

| # | Question | What it tests |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Can this survive long enough for structure to matter? | Survival horizon |
| 2 | Does failure here look like erosion, not explosion? | Failure mode |
| 3 | Is legitimacy more valuable than speed? | Value hierarchy |
| 4 | Will clarity actually change outcomes? | Strategy impact |
| 5 | Does this work without going viral? | Virality dependence |

**Scoring**: 4-5 "yes" = proceed. 2-3 = caution. 0-1 = decline.

```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/josebarnetche/memola.git
```

2. Copy the skill files to your Claude Code skills directory:
```bash

## Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **MEMOLA** (core) | Complete strategic operating system | Full strategic engagements |
| **MEMOLA-Diagnosis** | Terrain assessment and regime classification | First step for any engagement |
| **MEMOLA-Platforms** | Platform viability and phased building | Evaluating platform opportunities |
| **MEMOLA-Governance** | Decision authority and boundary setting | Setting up engagement structure |
| **MEMOLA-Local** | NEA Argentina regional calibration | Working with Argentine interior clients |
| **MEMOLA-Creative** | Music, art, and cultural sector strategy | Working with artists, labels, cultural events |

### Skill Stacking

Skills work best when stacked in sequence:

```
MEMOLA-Diagnosis (required first)
        ↓
MEMOLA-Governance (required for engagement)
        ↓
[MEMOLA-Platforms | MEMOLA-Local | MEMOLA-Creative]
        (optional calibration layers)
```

**Never skip Diagnosis.** It's the terrain filter that makes everything else work.

## Quick Start Tutorial

### Step 1: Run Terrain Assessment

When evaluating a potential client or project:

```
User: Run terrain assessment for [Client Name]

MEMOLA will ask the five diagnostic questions and classify the terrain as:
- Foundation (proceed with MEMOLA)
- Camp (MEMOLA is wrong tool)
- Mixed (proceed with caution)
```

### Step 2: Check Governance

If terrain assessment passes:

```
User: Governance check for [Client Name]

MEMOLA will verify:
- Decision authority exists
- Scope is definable
- Ownership is clear
- Exit conditions can be set
```

### Step 3: Run Strategic Diagnosis

If governance clears:

```
User: Diagnose [Client Name]

MEMOLA will:
- Map the current reality
- Identify 1-3 core strategic problems
- Define positioning constraints
- Output a strategic diagnosis document
```

### Step 4: Design Systems

With diagnosis complete:

```
User: Structure [Project Name]

MEMOLA will:
- Design brand architecture
- Create asset hierarchy
- Define priority roadmap
- Output structured system ready for execution
```

## Triggers

Use these phrases to invoke MEMOLA:

| Action | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| Assess terrain fit | "terrain assessment [project]" |
| Run five questions | "diagnostic questions [project]" |
| Run full diagnosis | "diagnose [project/client]" |
| Design system structure | "structure [project]" |
| Assess platform viability | "evaluate platform for [domain]" |
| Check governance fit | "governance check [project]" |
| Review failure modes | "failure mode analysis" |
| Apply brand principles | "brand filter [content]" |

## The Learning System

MEMOLA includes an **agentic learning framework** that evolves through use:

```
.agents/
├── FRAMEWORK.md          # Learning architecture
├── AGENT_OPINION.md      # Agent's perspective on doctrine
├── database/
│   ├── entities.json     # Analyzed entities
│   ├── patterns.json     # Discovered patterns
│   ├── relationships.json # Entity connections
│   ├── learnings.json    # Extracted insights
│   └── taxonomy.json     # Classification system
├── logs/
│   └── session-*.md      # Thinking session logs
└── reports/
    └── *.md              # Research reports
```

The agent learns from its own application. Every engagement contributes to the pattern library.

## Key Concepts

### Foundation vs Sprint Terrain

| Foundation Terrain | Sprint Terrain |
|----------------|--------------|
| Weathering failure | Rupture failure |
| Trust compounds | Speed determines survival |
| Legitimacy > speed | First-mover wins |
| Reputation outlasts hype | Network effects are the only moat |
| MEMOLA applies | MEMOLA does NOT apply |

### Governance Requirements

MEMOLA requires all four to proceed:

1. **Clear Decision Authority** — Someone can say yes
2. **Defined Scope** — Boundaries are explicit
3. **Explicit Ownership** — Responsibilities are assigned
4. **Exit Conditions** — How and when to leave

Missing any one = do not proceed.

### Known Failure Modes

MEMOLA can fail through:

- **Over-execution** — Doing too much, too fast
- **Boutique drift** — Becoming generic to chase revenue
- **Platform prematurity** — Building technology before proving value
- **Identity dilution** — Becoming what you said you weren't
- **Aesthetic capture** — Prioritizing looks over substance

## Case Archetypes

MEMOLA work typically fits these patterns:

| Archetype | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Institution modernization | 125-year rural society going digital |
| Artisanal to scalable brands | Family silversmith expanding nationally |
| Cultural events as platforms | Annual festival becoming year-round community |
| Niche vertical aggregators | Agricultural information platform |

---

## Philosophy

### MEMOLA Is Enacted, Not Possessed

You don't "have" MEMOLA. You practice it. The framework is a verb, not a noun.

### Self-Selection Is Integrity

MEMOLA knows what it's for. Declining misaligned work is precision, not weakness.

### Provincial Origin Is a Feature

From the edge, you see what centralized thinking misses. Mercedes → Berlin → Paris is a path, not a limitation.

### Trust Is Infrastructure

MEMOLA builds trust-generation machines. Not sprintaigns. Not content. Systems that produce trust over time.
