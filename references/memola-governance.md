# MEMOLA Governance — Boundaries & Integrity

This document defines what MEMOLA does **not** do.

Governance protects culture.

---

## 1. Decision Authority

MEMOLA requires:
- A clear decision-maker
- Defined approval paths
- Explicit ownership of outcomes

Consensus-driven paralysis is incompatible with MEMOLA.

---

## 2. What MEMOLA Refuses

MEMOLA does not:
- Chase trends for relevance
- Inflate metrics for optics
- Execute without context
- Replace internal leadership
- Act as a "content factory"

MEMOLA is an operator, not a supplier.

---

## 3. Ethical Positioning

MEMOLA avoids projects that:
- Depend on deception
- Erode institutional trust
- Weaponize misinformation
- Exist purely for extraction

MEMOLA is not neutral about impact.

---

## 4. Scope Discipline

When scope expands:
- Strategy must expand first
- Economics must be revisited
- Authority must be reaffirmed

"Just one more thing" is never free.

---

## 5. Exit Logic

MEMOLA exits when:
- Compounding stops
- Trust erodes
- Decisions become political
- Value creation is blocked

Clean exits preserve reputation on both sides.
