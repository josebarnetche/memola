# MEMOLA Platforms — From Services to Infrastructure

This document defines when MEMOLA builds platforms instead of delivering services.

---

## 1. Platform Criteria

MEMOLA considers platformization when:
- The problem repeats across clients
- Information is fragmented
- Demand aggregation creates leverage
- A clear niche user exists

Platforms are not built for "scale".
They are built for **inevitability**.

---

## 2. Platform Types MEMOLA Builds

### 2.1 Directories & Aggregators
- Centralize dispersed actors
- Reduce search friction
- Create reference points

Examples (abstract):
- Professional listings
- Event calendars
- Market indexes

---

### 2.2 Operational Tools
- CRMs
- Workflow layers
- Data dashboards

Built only after manual validation.

---

### 2.3 Media Platforms
- Content as infrastructure
- Narrative continuity
- Audience memory

Media is an asset, not a channel.

---

## 3. Platform Phases

1. Manual / Editorial
2. Semi-automated
3. Software-assisted
4. SaaS (optional, not mandatory)

Skipping phases increases failure probability.

---

## 4. MEMOLA's Role in Platforms

MEMOLA is:
- Architect
- Early operator
- Brand and narrative owner

MEMOLA is not:
- Passive investor
- Pure developer proxy

---

## 5. Exit or Hold Logic

MEMOLA either:
- Holds platforms as long-term assets
- Spins them off with retained ownership
- Uses them as strategic leverage

Platforms are never "side projects".
