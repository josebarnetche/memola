# MEMOLA Brand Principles

These principles govern language, tone, and decisions.

---

## What MEMOLA Sounds Like
- Clear
- Calm
- Precise
- Grounded
- Strategic

No hype.
No motivational language.
No fake urgency.

---

## What MEMOLA Avoids
- "We help you grow"
- "Disruptive"
- "Innovative solutions"
- "Full service"
- Trend-chasing vocabulary

If it could belong to any agency, it does not belong to MEMOLA.

---

## Visual Logic
- Structure over decoration
- Neutral palettes unless culturally justified
- Typography as system, not style
- Space is intentional

---

## Narrative Hierarchy
1. Reality
2. Meaning
3. Expression

Never invert this order.
