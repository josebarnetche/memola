# MEMOLA Method
## Operational Framework for Compound Marketing
**Version 3.0.0 | February 2026**

---

## Core Philosophy

MEMOLA operates on a single principle: **marketing infrastructure compounds when you do things once, document them, then remove yourself from the loop.**

This is not about scaling through hiring. It's about scaling through systematization until the system runs itself.

---

## Part 1: Delivery Archetypes

Four concrete service patterns. Not phases. Not tiers. Patterns that match real client needs.

---

### Archetype A: Template Workflow
**~30 min/month | $166-200/month**

**What it is:** Systematized content delivery where Jose's involvement is near-zero. The client receives consistent output from documented templates executed by delegated labor or automation.

**Real clients:**
- JUA (aesthetic clinic)
- El Tigre (rural property)
- Rural real estate accounts

**Deliverables:**
- 4 posts/month from proven templates
- Scheduling via pre-approved content bank
- Monthly performance screenshot

**Jose's role:** Review output once monthly. Intervene only on template failures.

**Quality gate:** Does output match template? (Y/N, 30 seconds)

**Pricing logic:** $166-200 covers delegated execution ($100-150 Fiverr) plus margin for template maintenance and occasional oversight. Client pays for consistency, not creativity.

---

### Archetype B: Campaign Management
**~10 hrs/month | $1,200/month**

**What it is:** Active management of marketing campaigns with real optimization decisions. Jose reviews data, adjusts targeting, refreshes creative, and makes strategic calls.

**Real client:**
- Lossada (real estate development)

**Deliverables:**
- Weekly campaign review and adjustment
- Monthly performance report with recommendations
- Creative refresh as needed
- Budget optimization

**Jose's role:** Weekly active management. Strategic decisions on spend allocation. Creative direction.

**Quality gate:** Is ROAS above target? Are leads qualified? (Y/N, 2 minutes via dashboard)

**Pricing logic:** $1,200 reflects real expertise time. Not delegatable until RADAR automates pattern recognition. Premium for active decision-making.

---

### Archetype C: Local Activation
**~18 hrs/month | $500/month**

**What it is:** Community-embedded marketing that requires local presence and relationship management. Cannot be fully systematized because value comes from Jose's network position.

**Real client:**
- Rincon de Luna (local venue/events)

**Deliverables:**
- Event promotion and coordination
- Local partnership activation
- Community engagement management
- On-ground content capture

**Jose's role:** High-touch involvement. Physical presence for events. Relationship maintenance.

**Quality gate:** Did event meet attendance target? Is community engagement growing? (Y/N, 2 minutes)

**Pricing logic:** $500 is below market rate but builds strategic position. Local credibility compounds. Accept lower margin for network effects.

---

### Archetype D: Strategic Project
**One-time | Custom pricing**

**What it is:** High-value projects that establish long-term relationships or create significant portfolio pieces. Not recurring. Not systematizable. Worth doing for strategic reasons.

**Real client:**
- Rewilding Argentina (conservation organization)

**Deliverables:**
- Project-specific scope
- Portfolio-quality output
- Relationship establishment

**Jose's role:** Full engagement. This is craft work, not system work.

**Quality gate:** Does client want to continue relationship? Is output portfolio-worthy? (Y/N)

**Pricing logic:** Price to value, not to hours. Consider strategic benefit. Rewilding opened doors that hourly billing never would.

---

## Part 2: Jose's Principle

### "Do Once, SOP, Delegate"

Every task Jose does manually is a failure of systematization—unless it's the first time doing that task.

---

### Stage 1: Jose Does It
**Purpose:** Learn requirements through execution

- First three times doing any task, Jose executes personally
- Observe friction points, client feedback, failure modes
- Document what actually matters vs. what seemed important

**Exit criteria:** Task completed 3x with consistent acceptable results

---

### Stage 2: Jose Documents It
**Purpose:** Create SOP after pattern emerges

- After 3x execution, write SOP
- SOP must be executable by someone with no context
- Include: trigger conditions, steps, quality checks, common failures
- Test SOP by having someone else execute while Jose observes

**Exit criteria:** Documented SOP that produces consistent results without Jose explaining

---

### Stage 3: Jose Delegates It
**Purpose:** Remove Jose from execution loop

- Delegate to Fiverr contractor ($100-150/month typical)
- Jose reviews output, not process
- Intervene only on quality gate failures

**Exit criteria:** 3 consecutive months of acceptable output without Jose intervention

---

### Stage 4: System Does It
**Purpose:** Remove human from loop entirely

- This is RADAR destination
- Automation handles execution and basic quality checking
- Human intervention only for edge cases and strategic decisions

**Exit criteria:** System runs without human input for standard cases

---

## Part 3: Quality Gates

Quality gates must be binary and take less than 2 minutes. If you're debating, the gate is broken.

---

### Template Workflow Gates

| Gate | Question | Check Time |
|------|----------|------------|
| Output Match | Does deliverable match template? | 30 sec |
| Schedule Met | Did posts go out on schedule? | 15 sec |
| Client Silent | No complaints this period? | 15 sec |

---

### Campaign Management Gates

| Gate | Question | Check Time |
|------|----------|------------|
| ROAS Target | Is ROAS above agreed threshold? | 30 sec |
| Lead Quality | Are >80% of leads qualified? | 1 min |
| Budget Pace | Is spend on track for month? | 30 sec |

---

### Local Activation Gates

| Gate | Question | Check Time |
|------|----------|------------|
| Event Attendance | Did event hit attendance target? | 30 sec |
| Engagement Trend | Is engagement up vs. last period? | 1 min |
| Partner Satisfied | No partner complaints? | 30 sec |

---

### Strategic Project Gates

| Gate | Question | Check Time |
|------|----------|------------|
| Scope Complete | All agreed deliverables done? | 1 min |
| Client Happy | Would they refer you? | 30 sec |
| Portfolio Ready | Is output worth showing? | 30 sec |

---

### Gate Failure Protocol

1. Gate fails -> Document failure
2. First failure -> Fix and continue
3. Second failure same type -> SOP review
4. Third failure same type -> Archetype mismatch, restructure engagement

---

## Part 4: Pricing Logic

Pricing follows archetype, not hours. Hours are Jose's problem, not client's.

---

### Template Workflow: $166-200/month

**Cost structure:**
- Delegated execution: $100-150/month (Fiverr)
- Jose oversight: 30 min/month
- Template maintenance: amortized

**Margin:** 25-40%

**Raise price when:** Templates require less maintenance than expected

**Lower price when:** Never. Drop client if margin negative.

---

### Campaign Management: $1,200/month

**Cost structure:**
- Jose time: ~10 hrs/month
- Tools: ~$50/month amortized
- No delegation (expertise required)

**Effective rate:** ~$115/hour

**Raise price when:** Results consistently exceed targets

**Lower price when:** Taking on multiple campaigns creates efficiency (bundle discount only)

---

### Local Activation: $500/month

**Cost structure:**
- Jose time: ~18 hrs/month
- Local expenses: variable

**Effective rate:** ~$28/hour

**Why accept:** Strategic position value exceeds hourly rate. Network effects. Portfolio building.

**Exit when:** Strategic value exhausted and better options exist

---

### Strategic Project: Custom

**Pricing method:**
1. Estimate client value of outcome
2. Price at 10-20% of that value
3. Floor: equivalent hourly would be $150/hr minimum
4. Consider: portfolio value, relationship value, learning value

---

## Part 5: RADAR Evolution Path

RADAR is the destination: systems that run themselves. Evolution is staged, not instant.

---

### Level 0: Manual
**Current state for new tasks**

- Jose executes everything
- Data in spreadsheets or memory
- No automation
- Full human dependency

**Advance when:** Task completed 3x with consistent results

---

### Level 1: Data
**SOP + Tracked metrics**

- Documented process exists
- Key metrics tracked consistently
- Delegation possible
- Human still drives

**Advance when:** 3 months of delegated execution without intervention

---

### Level 2: Dashboard
**Visible, actionable data**

- Real-time or near-real-time metrics
- Alerts for out-of-bounds conditions
- Decision support (not decision making)
- Human reviews, doesn't execute

**Advance when:** Patterns emerge that could be automated

---

### Level 3: Product
**Self-running system**

- Automation handles standard cases
- Human handles exceptions only
- System improves through feedback
- Potential to externalize (sell as product/service)

**This is RADAR:** Recognition, Analysis, Delivery, Automated, Repeatable

---

### Current Client Positions

| Client | Current Level | Next Level Target |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| JUA | Level 1 | Level 2 (Q2 2026) |
| El Tigre | Level 1 | Level 2 (Q3 2026) |
| Lossada | Level 1 | Level 2 (Q2 2026) |
| Rincon | Level 0 | Level 1 (Q2 2026) |
| Rewilding | N/A (Project) | N/A |

---

## Part 6: Operational Rhythm

Systems need heartbeats. Here's the rhythm that keeps MEMOLA running.

---

### Daily: NEXO Checks (15 min)

**Morning sweep:**
- [ ] Any client messages requiring response?
- [ ] Any scheduled posts fail to publish?
- [ ] Any campaign alerts (overspend, underperform)?
- [ ] Any contractor questions?

**Decision:** Anything need Jose today? If no, day is free for strategic work.

---

### Weekly: Friday Review (45 min)

**Metrics check:**
- [ ] All clients at or above targets?
- [ ] Any quality gates failed this week?
- [ ] Contractor output acceptable?
- [ ] Hours tracked vs. archetype expectations?

**Decisions:**
- What needs SOP update?
- What's ready to delegate?
- Any client conversations needed?

**Output:** Brief status note in MEMOR

---

### Monthly: Position Assessment (2 hrs)

**First Monday of month:**

**Per client:**
- [ ] Review all quality gates
- [ ] Confirm archetype still fits
- [ ] Check margin reality vs. expectation
- [ ] Identify RADAR level advancement opportunities

**System level:**
- [ ] Any new SOPs needed?
- [ ] Any delegation ready?
- [ ] Pricing adjustments needed?
- [ ] Strategic opportunities emerging?

**Output:** Monthly MEMOLA status in MEMOR

---

### Quarterly: Strategic Review (half day)

**Portfolio level:**
- Client mix assessment
- Archetype balance (too many Local Activations = trapped)
- Revenue vs. effort analysis
- System maturity assessment

**RADAR level:**
- What's ready to level up?
- What's stuck? Why?
- What should be sunset?

**Decisions:**
- Client additions/removals
- Pricing changes
- System investments

---

## Part 7: Agent System Integration

Four agents. Clear responsibilities. No overlap.

---

---

### Agent Interaction Flow

```
Opportunity -> VIGIL (qualify) -> Jose (decide) -> NEXO (execute)
                                                       |
                                                  MEMOR (log)
                                                       |
                                                  PULSO (collect feedback)
                                                       |
                                                  MEMOR (pattern analysis)
                                                       |
                                                  Jose (strategic adjustment)
```
