# MEMOLA Method — Operational Reference

This document expands the MEMOLA Method into actionable logic.
It is not a checklist; it is a decision system.

---

## 1. Phase 1 — Diagnosis (Reality Mapping)

Goal: Understand what *actually exists*, not what is claimed.

### Inputs
- Business model (how money is really made)
- Power structure (who decides)
- Market saturation and dynamics
- Operational constraints (time, money, people)
- Cultural and regional context
- Digital maturity level

### Key Questions
- What would break if demand doubled tomorrow?
- What part of the business cannot be digitized (yet)?
- What value already exists but is invisible?
- Where is friction mistaken for "tradition"?

### Outputs
- Strategic diagnosis (1–3 core problems max)
- Clear positioning constraints
- Feasible scope definition

No execution begins without this phase.

---

## 2. Phase 2 — Structure (Asset Design)

Goal: Turn diagnosis into **systems**, not deliverables.

### Core Structures
- Brand architecture (what exists, what does not)
- Digital assets (domains, sites, platforms)
- Narrative layers (institutional, commercial, cultural)
- Funnel logic (even if no ads are run)
- Ownership model (who controls what)

### MEMOLA Rule
If it cannot be diagrammed, it is not structured.

### Outputs
- System map
- Asset hierarchy
- Priority roadmap (what matters first)

---

## 3. Phase 3 — Execution (Controlled Force)

Goal: Execute with precision, not noise.

### Execution Principles
- Minimal viable excellence
- Reuse before reinventing
- Manual before automated (until proven)
- Quality gates over speed

### Typical Execution Domains
- Branding & design systems
- Web & platform development
- Content production
- Paid and organic distribution
- Tooling and automation

### Outputs
- Live assets
- Operational workflows
- Measurement baselines

---

## 4. Phase 4 — Compounding (Value Accumulation)

Goal: Ensure work gains value over time.

### Compounding Mechanisms
- Asset reuse across channels
- Narrative depth accumulation
- Audience trust
- Data and learnings
- Optional platformization (SaaS, directories, tools)

### Outputs
- Strategic optionality
- Reduced marginal effort
- Increased leverage

If value does not compound, MEMOLA disengages or restructures.
