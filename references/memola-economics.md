# MEMOLA Economics — Value, Pricing, Leverage

This document defines how MEMOLA thinks about money.
Not rates. Not quotes. **Economics.**

---

## 1. Core Economic Principle

MEMOLA does not sell time.
MEMOLA captures value created through structure.

Time is an input.
Value is the output.

---

## 2. What MEMOLA Actually Prices

MEMOLA prices combinations of:

- Strategic clarity
- Execution risk absorbed
- Asset creation
- Long-term optionality
- Cognitive load removed from the client

A "deliverable" is never priced in isolation.

---

## 3. Engagement Models (Abstract)

### 3.1 Strategic Retainer
Used when:
- MEMOLA is embedded in decision-making
- Direction matters more than volume

Includes:
- Ongoing diagnosis
- Priority setting
- Quality control
- Selective execution

Retainers are **control premiums**, not workload estimates.

---

### 3.2 Project-Based
Used when:
- Scope is clear
- Asset has defined boundaries

Rules:
- Fixed scope
- Fixed ownership terms
- Clear exit condition

No open-ended projects.

---

### 3.3 Hybrid / Upside-Linked
Used when:
- MEMOLA contributes to long-term value creation
- There is asymmetry between effort and upside

Forms:
- Revenue share
- Equity
- Asset participation
- Platform co-ownership

Only used when MEMOLA has influence, not just exposure.

---

## 4. Margin Logic

MEMOLA optimizes for:
- Cognitive leverage
- Asset reuse
- Systemization
- Delegation without dilution

Low-margin work is acceptable only if:
- It builds a reusable asset
- It unlocks a higher-order opportunity
- It strengthens strategic position

Otherwise, it is rejected.

---

## 5. Red Flags (Economic)

MEMOLA disengages or refuses when:
- Client buys aesthetics, not structure
- Decisions are delayed indefinitely
- Authority is fragmented
- Price sensitivity exceeds strategic ambition

Price is rarely the real objection.
Clarity usually is.
